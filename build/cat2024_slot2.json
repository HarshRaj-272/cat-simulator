Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question. (. . .) There are three other common drivers for carnivore-human attacks, some of which are more preventable than others. Natural aggression-based conflicts \u2013 such as those involving females protecting their young or animals protecting a food source \u2013 can often be avoided as long as people stay away from those animals and their food. Carnivores that recognise humans as a means to get food, are a different story. As they become more reliant on human food they might find at campsites or in rubbish bins, they become less avoidant of humans. Losing that instinctive fear response puts them into more situations where they could get into an altercation with a human, which often results in that bear being put down by humans. \u201cA fed bear is a dead bear,\u201d says Servheen, referring to a common saying among biologists and conservationists. Predatory or predation-related attacks are quite rare, only accounting for 17% of attacks in North America since 1955. They occur when a carnivore views a human as prey and hunts it like it would any other animal it uses for food. (. . .) Then there are animal attacks provoked by people taking pictures with them or feeding them in natural settings such as national parks which often end with animals being euthanised out of precaution. \u201cEventually, that animal becomes habituated to people, and [then] bad things happen to the animal. And the folks who initially wanted to make that connection don\u2019t necessarily realise that,\u201d says Christine Wilkinson, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, California, who\u2019s been studying coyote-human conflicts. After conducting countless postmortems on all types of carnivore-human attacks spanning 75 years, Penteriani\u2019s team believes 50% could have been avoided if humans reacted differently. A 2017 study co-authored by Penteriani found that engaging in risky behaviour around large carnivores increases the likelihood of an attack. Two of the most common risky behaviours are parents leaving their children to play outside unattended and walking an unleashed dog, according to the study. Wilkinson says 66% of coyote attacks involve a dog. \u201c[People] end up in a situation where their dog is being chased, or their dog chases a coyote, or maybe they\u2019re walking their dog near a den that\u2019s marked, and the coyote wants to escort them away,\u201d says Wilkinson. Experts believe climate change also plays a part in the escalation of human-carnivore conflicts, but the correlation still needs to be ironed out. \u201cAs finite resources become scarcer, carnivores and people are coming into more frequent contact, which means that more conflict could occur,\u201d says Jen Miller, international programme specialist for the US Fish & Wildlife Service. For example, she says, there was an uptick in lion attacks in western India during a drought when lions and people were relying on the same water sources. (. . .) The likelihood of human-carnivore conflicts appears to be higher in areas of low-income countries dominated by vast rural landscapes and farmland, according to Penteriani\u2019s research. \u201cThere are a lot of working landscapes in the Global South that are really heterogeneous, that are interspersed with carnivore habitats, forests and savannahs, which creates a lot more opportunity for these encounters, just statistically,\u201d says Wilkinson.

Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question. The job of a peer reviewer is thankless. Collectively, academics spend around 70 million hours every year evaluating each other\u2019s manuscripts on the behalf of scholarly journals \u2014 and they usually receive no monetary compensation and little if any recognition for their effort. Some do it as a way to keep abreast with developments in their field; some simply see it as a duty to the discipline. Either way, academic publishing would likely crumble without them. In recent years, some scientists have begun posting their reviews online, mainly to claim credit for their work. Sites like Publons allow researchers to either share entire referee reports or simply list the journals for whom they\u2019ve carried out a review\u2026. The rise of Publons suggests that academics are increasingly placing value on the work of peer review and asking others, such as grant funders, to do the same. While that\u2019s vital in the publish-or-perish culture of academia, there\u2019s also immense value in the data underlying peer review. Sharing peer review data could help journals stamp out fraud, inefficiency, and systemic bias in academic publishing.\u2026. Peer review data could also help root out bias. Last year, a study based on peer review data for nearly 24,000 submissions to the biomedical journal eLife found that women and non- Westerners were vastly underrepresented among peer reviewers. Only around one in every five reviewers was female, and less than two percent of reviewers were based in developing countries\u2026. Openly publishing peer review data could perhaps also help journals address another problem in academic publishing: fraudulent peer reviews. For instance, a minority of authors have been known to use phony email addresses to pose as an outside expert and review their own manuscripts.\u2026 Opponents of open peer review commonly argue that confidentiality is vital to the integrity of the review process; referees may be less critical of manuscripts if their reports are published, especially if they are revealing their identities by signing them. Some also hold concerns that open reviewing may deter referees from agreeing to judge manuscripts in the first place, or that they\u2019ll take longer to do so out of fear of scrutiny\u2026. Even when the content of reviews and the identity of reviewers can\u2019t be shared publicly, perhaps journals could share the data with outside researchers for study. Or they could release other figures that wouldn\u2019t compromise the anonymity of reviews but that might answer important questions about how long the reviewing process takes, how many researchers editors have to reach out to on average to find one who will carry out the work, and the geographic distribution of peer reviewers. Of course, opening up data underlying the reviewing process will not fix peer review entirely, and there may be instances in which there are valid reasons to keep the content of peer reviews hidden and the identity of the referees confidential. But the norm should shift from opacity in all cases to opacity only when necessary. SubQuestion No : 10 Q.10 According to the passage, which of the following is the only reason NOT given in favour of making peer review data public? Ans 1.It can tackle the problem of selecting appropriately qualified reviewers for academic writing. 2.It could address various inefficiencies and fraudulent practices that continue in academic publishing process. 3.It will deal with peer review fraud such as authors publishing bogus reviews of their work. 4.It would highlight the gender and race biases currently existing in the selection of reviewers.

Based on the passage, choose the best answer for each question. [S]pices were a global commodity centuries before European voyages. There was a complex chain of relations, yet consumers had little knowledge of producers and vice versa. Desire for spices helped fuel European colonial empires to create political, military and commercial networks under a single power. Historians know a fair amount about the supply of spices in Europe during the medieval period \u2013 the origins, methods of transportation, the prices \u2013 but less about demand. Why go to such extraordinary efforts to procure expensive products from exotic lands? Still, demand was great enough to inspire the voyages of Christopher Columbus and Vasco Da Gama, launching the first fateful wave of European colonialism. . . . So, why were spices so highly prized in Europe in the centuries from about 1000 to 1500? One widely disseminated explanation for medieval demand for spices was that they covered the taste of spoiled meat. . . . Medieval purchasers consumed meat much fresher than what the average city-dweller in the developed world of today has at hand. However, refrigeration was not available, and some hot spices have been shown to serve as an anti-bacterial agent. Salting, smoking or drying meat were other means of preservation. Most spices used in cooking began as medical ingredients, and throughout the Middle Ages spices were used as both medicines and condiments. Above all, medieval recipes involve the combination of medical and culinary lore in order to balance food's humeral properties and prevent disease. Most spices were hot and dry and so appropriate in sauces to counteract the moist and wet properties supposedly possessed by most meat and fish. . . . Where spices came from was known in a vague sense centuries before the voyages of Columbus. Just how vague may be judged by looking at medieval world maps . . . To the medieval European imagination, the East was exotic and alluring. Medieval maps often placed India close to the so-called Earthly Paradise, the Garden of Eden described in the Bible. Geographical knowledge has a lot to do with the perceptions of spices\u2019 relative scarcity and the reasons for their high prices. An example of the varying notions of scarcity is the conflicting information about how pepper is harvested. As far back as the 7th century Europeans thought that pepper in India grew on trees \"guarded\" by serpents that would bite and poison anyone who attempted to gather the fruit. The only way to harvest pepper was to burn the trees, which would drive the snakes underground. Of course, this bit of lore would explain the shriveled black peppercorns, but not white, pink or other colors. Spices never had the enduring allure or power of gold and silver or the commercial potential of new products such as tobacco, indigo or sugar. But the taste for spices did continue for a while beyond the Middle Ages. As late as the 17th century, the English and the Dutch were struggling for control of the Spice Islands: Dutch New Amsterdam, or New York, was exchanged by the British for one of the Moluccan Islands where nutmeg was grown. SubQuestion No : 16 Q.16 If a trader brought white peppercorns from India to medieval Europe, all of the following are unlikely to happen, EXCEPT: Ans 1.the price of spices would decrease. 2.medieval maps would be used as navigational aids. 3.pepper would no longer be considered exotic. 4.Europeans would doubt the story of pepper harvesting.

Choose the option that best captures the essence of the passage. Recent important scientific findings have emerged from crossing the boundaries of scientific fields. They stem from physicists collaborating with biologists, sociologists and others, to answer questions about our world. But physicists and their potential collaborators often find their cultures out of sync. For one, physicists often discard a lot of information while extracting broad patterns; for other scientists, information is not readily disposed. Further, many non-physicists are uncomfortable with mathematical models. Still, the desire to work on something new and different is real, and there are clear benefits from the collision of views. Ans 1.Large data sets and mathematical models in physics research combined with the research methods of non-physicist collaborators have yielded important scientific findings.",

Choose the option that best captures the essence of the passage. Different from individuals, states conduct warfare operations using the DIME model\u2014 \u201cdiplomacy, information, military, and economics.\u201d Most states do everything they can to inflict pain and confusion on their enemies before deploying the military. In fact, attacks on vectors of information are a well-worn tactic of war and usually are the first target when the charge begins. It\u2019s common for telecom data and communications networks to be routinely monitored by governments, which is why the open data policies of the web are so concerning to many advocates of privacy and human rights. With the worldwide adoption of social media, more governments are getting involved in low-grade information warfare through the use of cyber troops. According to a study by the Oxford Internet Institute in 2020, cyber troops are \u201cgovernment or political party actors tasked with manipulating public opinion online.\u201d The Oxford research group was able to identify 81 countries with active cyber troop operations utilizing many different strategies to spread false information, including spending millions on online advertising. Ans 1.Governments primarily use the DIME model to deploy cyber troops who practise low- grade information warfare, seeking to manipulate public opinion with the objective of inflicting pain and confusion on their enemies. 2.Using the DIME model, together with military operations, many governments simultaneously conduct information warfare with the help of cyber troops and routinely monitor telecom data and communications networks. 3.Following the DIME model, many governments have taken advantage of open data policies of the web to deploy cyber troops who manipulate domestic public opinion, using advertising and other strategies to spread false information.",

Choose the option that best captures the essence of the passage. John Cleese told Fox News Digital that comedians do not have the freedom to be funny in 2022. \u201cThere\u2019s always been limitations on what they\u2019re allowed to say,\u201d Cleese said. \u201cI think it\u2019s particularly worrying at the moment because you can only create in an atmosphere of freedom, where you\u2019re not checking everything you say critically before you move on. What you have to be able to do is to build without knowing where you\u2019re going because you\u2019ve never been there before. That\u2019s what creativity is \u2014 you have to be allowed to build. And a lot of comedians now are sitting there and when they think of something, they say something like, \u2018Can I get away with it? I don\u2019t think so. So and so got into trouble, and he said that, oh, she said that.\u2019 You see what I mean? And that\u2019s the death of creativity.\u201d Ans 1.Comedians must not check what they think and say. They must go where no one has gone before. 2.Freedom and creativity are essential for comedy. Fear about offending people hinders originality. 3.Creativity and critical thinking cannot work together. Comedians must first be creative, and later be critical. 4.Comedians are being prevented from saying what they want and that is the death of this art form.
